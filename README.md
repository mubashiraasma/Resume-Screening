# Resume-Screening

## Project Description
This Resume Screening System is designed to classify resumes into various job categories using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. This project aims to streamline the hiring process by efficiently categorizing resumes based on their content.


## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering with Word2Vec, and LDA
- Model training with Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The Dataset is downloaded from kaggle. It consists of resumes and their corresponding job categories.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier with features engineered using Word2Vec, and LDA. Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The results includes the evaluation metrics and visualizations of the model's performance.

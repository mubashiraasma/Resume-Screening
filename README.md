# Resume-Screening

## Project Description
The Automated Resume Screening System is designed to classify resumes into various job categories using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. This project aims to streamline the hiring process by efficiently categorizing resumes based on their content.


## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering with TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and LDA
- Model training with Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK
- Gensim
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset consists of resumes and their corresponding job categories. Ensure that the dataset is in a structured format suitable for processing.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier with features engineered using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and LDA. Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The results includes the evaluation metrics and visualizations of the model's performance.
